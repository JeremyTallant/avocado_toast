A simple smashed avocado toast can be made with five ingredients: one ripe avocado, half a lemon, a big pinch of salt flakes, two slices of sourdough bread and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.\n","\n","It's no small feat that most of these ingredients are readily available in grocery stores. In this project, you'll conduct a supply chain analysis of the ingredients used in an avocado toast, utilizing the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. Through this analysis, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish. The data is contained in `.csv` files in the `data/` folder provided.\n","\n","After completing this project, you'll be armed with a list of ingredients and their countries of origin, and be well-positioned to launch into other analyses that explore how long, on average, these ingredients spend at sea.\n","\n","![](avocado_wallpaper.jpeg)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"339a6352-aed5-4b9e-a48f-1b91a7db9adb","metadata":{"executionTime":8,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import
